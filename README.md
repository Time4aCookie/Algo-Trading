# Algorithmic Trading System
I have used the TWS IBKR API and a TCP Socket to play around with a couple different trading strategies. Some of the arbitrage strategies I messed around with are below


## Strategies



- Dual class trading arb(BRKa and BRKb trades both ways, BNRE-must have locate)

- Options arbs(more of a well hedged position than an arb)
  
- Warrant vs. Stock arbs and Warrant vs. option arbs
